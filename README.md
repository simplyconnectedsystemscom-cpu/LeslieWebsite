# Leslie's Weaving Website

This is a modern, responsive website built to tell the story of Leslie's Weaving—bringing manufacturing back to America through neurodiverse mastery.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code (styles, scripts).
- **public/**: Contains static assets like images.
- **index.html**: The main entry point.

## Customization

### Images (Placeholders)
The current images in the `public/` folder are AI-generated placeholders designed to match the desired aesthetic. **To replace them with real photos of Leslie and her studio:**

1.  **Hero Background**: Replace `public/hero-texture.png` with a high-resolution close-up of Leslie's fabric or a texture.
2.  **Story Image**: Replace `public/hands-loom.png` with a photo of Leslie working hands-on at the loom.
3.  **Studio Image**: Replace `public/studio.png` with a wide shot of the actual studio space.

*Note: Ensure the new images have similar dimensions or aspect ratios for the best layout results.*
